\p{I am a research mathematician interested in applied topology, categorical logic, type theory, and homological algebra.}
\p{Currently, I primarily work in applied topology, at the [Camara Lab](https://camara-lab.org/), applying the Gromov-Wasserstein distance to the study of cell morphology. I also develop and maintain [CAJAL](https://github.com/CamaraLab/CAJAL), a Python package for the analysis of cell morphology.}
