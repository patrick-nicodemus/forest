\p{Hello, and welcome to my personal website.}
\p{I am a research mathematician interested in applied topology, category theory, homological algebra, type theory and formal verification.}
\p{At the moment, I primarily work on applied topology, in the [CÃ¡mara Lab](https://camara-lab.org/) at the University of Pennsylvania. Specifically, I apply the [Gromov-Wasserstein distance](\verb<<|https://media.adelaide.edu.au/acvt/Publications/2011/2011-Gromov%E2%80%93Wasserstein%20Distances%20and%20the%20Metric%20Approach%20to%20Object%20Matching.pdf<<) to the study of cell morphology. I also maintain [CAJAL](https://github.com/CamaraLab/CAJAL), a Python package for the analysis of cell morphology.}
\p{This website is under construction. Over the course of the next few weeks, I intend to start blogging here and uploading content, ideally, both my about my mathematics research, and potentially some literate formal verification using the Rocq theorem prover.}
\p{Some things you might find interesting:
