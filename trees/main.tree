\p{Hello, and welcome to my personal website.}
\p{I am a research mathematician interested in applied topology, category theory, homological algebra, type theory and formal verification.}
\p{At the moment, I primarily work on applied topology, in the [CÃ¡mara Lab](https://camara-lab.org/) at the University of Pennsylvania. Specifically, I apply the [Gromov-Wasserstein distance](\verb<<|https://media.adelaide.edu.au/acvt/Publications/2011/2011-Gromov%E2%80%93Wasserstein%20Distances%20and%20the%20Metric%20Approach%20to%20Object%20Matching.pdf<<) to the study of cell morphology. I also maintain [CAJAL](https://github.com/CamaraLab/CAJAL), a Python package for the analysis of cell morphology.}
\p{This website is under construction. Over the course of the next few weeks, I intend to start blogging here and uploading content, ideally, both my about my mathematics research, and potentially some literate formal verification using the Rocq theorem prover.}
\p{Some things you might find interesting:
\ul{
     \li{Some nice looking Rocq proofs:
       \ul{
          \li{[Webpage aesthetics](./MyTheory.html/MyTheory.A.html), i.e. basic use of LaTeX and Coqdoc.}
          \li{[Brief walkthrough](./MyTheory.html/MyTheory.nat_example.html) of Rocq's dependent pattern matching, illustrated via natural number arithmetic. No use of tactics.}
          \li{[Walkthrough continued](./MyTheory.html/MyTheory.eq_example.html), this time focusing on basic properties of equality. No use of tactics.}
          \li{[Some practice with Elpi](./MyTheory.html/MyTheory.elpi_exploration.html), a logic programming language which Enrico Tassi and others have been developing as a tactic language for the Rocq theorem prover.}
